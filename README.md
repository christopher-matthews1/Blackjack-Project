## Blackjack Rules
(adapted from https://www.fulltilt.com/casino/games/blackjack/rules/?no_redirect=1)

In general, the rules of blackjack are straightforward and can be picked up in minutes. However, each blackjack game type differs slightly in table rules, with the generic rules outlined below applying across all blackjack games along with some references to the current table rules.

Each round of blackjack begins with the player placing a bet. The minimum and maximum table stakes will be clearly displayed at the table, and you can choose your bet size by clicking on the denoting the value you wish to wager. After you place your wager, the dealer deals two cards face up in front of you and one card face up and one card face down to their own position.

The best hand is of course "blackjack", made up of an ace and any ten (that includes jacks, queens and kings), on the initial deal (your two first cards). As a hand, it's unbeatable, and can only be tied if the dealer's hand is also blackjack or, in this varient, totals 21. It's worth noting that blackjack pays more than other winning hands as you receive three-to-two (3:2) on your wager.

## Card Values and Payouts in Blackjack

A winning hand in blackjack typically pays one-to-one (1:1, also known as "evens" or "even money"). So if you wager 100, you usually receive 100, and will receive your original wager back. If you're dealt blackjack (and the dealer doesn't end with 21), you would receive 150, and will receive your original wager back.

If your hand ties with the dealer's hand – also known as a "push" – you receive the amount you wagered back, but are not awarded anything else. If you lose your hand, you forfeit your wager, which is taken by the house. Any exceptions to these general rules are outlined below.

Payouts usually occur after the dealer has completed the hand. The rules by which the dealer plays are strict, and differ slightly between game variations, so it's important to read the variant rules to check for any specific differences.

One such difference will be whether or not the dealer draws cards on a soft 17. Typically the dealer will draw cards until their hand value reaches 17 or higher. However, in some variants the dealer must stand on a soft 17, while in others variants, such as this one, the dealer must hit. In all Blackjack games, the dealer will hit on any hard or soft total of 16 or under.

## Splitting and Doubling Down

During a game you'll also be presented with several supplementary options, depending on the initial two cards dealt to you.

One such action is Splitting, which is essentially turning one hand into two, and can occur in the following ways:

If you have two starting cards that are equal in rank (King-Queen, Eight-Eight, etc…), an additional wager equal to the starting bet can be placed and a second hand is created
Both hands are played independently and will win, lose or push on their own merit.

In addition, the option to Double Down occurs in certain circumstances, permitting you the opportunity to double your initial wager. This also follows certain rules:

After the first two cards are dealt, you can add an additional wager equal to the starting bet and then receive exactly one extra card with which to improve your hand
Some blackjack game variants, such as this one, allow you to double down on any two first cards and others restrict you to doubling down on certain starting totals
In games in which it is permitted, doubling down can occur after splitting, with a few other elements to take into account:

After splitting a hand into two (or more) hands, you sometimes have the option to double down, adding another bet to the table.
A double down following a split follows the same rules as a normal double down.

## Blackjack Player Decisions

To recap, during a single round of blackjack you will be presented with a number of decisions to make (the decisions open to you depend upon the cards dealt and the game variant played), all of which will affect the result:

### Hit

You can request additional cards (one at a time) to improve your hands. Cards can be drawn until the total hand value is 21 (or higher).

### Stand

If the total value of your hand is 21 or if it is lower and you decide not to risk the chance of hitting again and possibly exceeding 21, you can choose to stand.

### Split

When your first two cards have equal value (King-Queen, Eight-Eight, etc…), you may place an additional wager (equal to the starting bet) and create a second hand to play.

### Double Down

You have the option to place an additional wager equal to the starting bet. Exactly one more card is drawn to the hand and you automatically stand.
